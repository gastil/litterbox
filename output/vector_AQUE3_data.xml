    <geographicDescription>Transect begins at the western edge of the hard substrate, nearly
      directly offshore of the river mouth (~200 m). Silt covered bedrock and small boulder
      substrate with little relief (0-0.5 m), some moderate sized areas of deep sand present along
      with Pterygophora and Diopatra beds. Depth is approximately 30'.</geographicDescription>
